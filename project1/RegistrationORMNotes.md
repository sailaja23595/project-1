Task-1: Creating database table.
By using SQL Alchemy created a users database table with the table name as tables.py and with the fields username and password.
Initaialized the constructor for variables username and password. Assigned username with primary key because it to be unique and password with nullable to enter the values.
created configuration session and set up the database.
While running the flask I got some errors and then I debuged it..
After running the flask,while I was creating a dataclip in heroku,I got some issue when I selected the table.
I have fixed that bug by changing the tablename.I have done this by taking the reference from NGLMS video and tutorilspoint.

Task-2 : Inserting the records.
Added alerts with close button in registration form for registration status.
In database.py I have created two messages one is for error message if the user is already exist, another message is for successful registration.
I have objects in registration form and assigned to database.py file.
I faced a problem with alert close button then when I cross checked I didnt used the script by adding that the close button was worked.
